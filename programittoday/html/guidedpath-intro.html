        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>"Hello World! This is the beginning of a learning journey." 
            Many times scrolling on reddit I stumble upon the question
            "I want to learn to program, where do I start?" This website
            aims to answer that question. Much like math, a strong foundation 
            is essential to master learning. Practice, practice and practice!!!
            It took years to go from addition to calculus, expect the same for programming.
            We will cover the absolute basics of programming to learning more complicated topics.

    <div id="Milestones">
        <h2>Milestones</h2>
        <p> What would you like to get out of this website? The information provided here is a start,
            you must be willing to create something with the skills you gain. These skills are gained but only perfected 
            when you make use of them. Jot down some goals; my advice make some that can be accomplished in a day and some 
            that take a few weeks to months. You will be operating on motivation at the start but once that dies down 
            seeing progress is beneficial to your journey. Source: A brutally honest dev. 
            <h4>Ideas</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Simple Goal: Print a greeting with user input.</li>
                <li>Short-Term Goal: Create a calculator for basic math.</li>
                <li>Long-Term Goal: Build a to-do list with file saving.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="Mindset">
        <h2>Mindset</h2>
        <p> Your mindset matters, understand that you may have imposter syndrome, 
            moments of being stuck. You might think programming isn't meant for you because:
            "I'm too stupid," "I'm old," "This is too hard." None of that is true, If you truly 
            want to learn something, dedicate time to learn it. The best time to plant a tree
            was 20 years ago, the next best day is today.
